E*TRADE Developer Support Request - OAuth Callback URL Registration

Date: February 18, 2026

Subject: Request to Register OAuth Callback URL for Production API Key

Dear E*TRADE Developer Support,

I am writing to request assistance with registering an OAuth callback URL for my E*TRADE API application. Despite previous communications indicating the callback URL was registered, my API calls are still being rejected.

---

APPLICATION DETAILS:

API Key (Production): 353ce1949c42c71cec4785343aa36539
Environment: Production
Current Configuration: oauth_acceptable_callback=oob (out-of-band/manual)

---

CALLBACK URL TO REGISTER:

https://web-production-9f73cd.up.railway.app/api/auth/callback

---

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

When attempting to obtain an OAuth request token with the callback URL parameter, E*TRADE's API returns the following error:

HTTP Status: 400 Bad Request
Error Message: oauth_problem=callback_rejected,oauth_acceptable_callback=oob

This error indicates that my production API key is still configured to accept only "oob" (out-of-band) callbacks, meaning the callback URL registration has not taken effect.

---

TECHNICAL DETAILS OF FAILED REQUEST:

Request Token URL: https://api.etrade.com/oauth/request_token
HTTP Method: GET
OAuth Parameters:
  - oauth_callback: https://web-production-9f73cd.up.railway.app/api/auth/callback
  - oauth_consumer_key: 353ce1949c42c71cec4785343aa36539
  - oauth_signature_method: HMAC-SHA1

Response Received:
{
  "error": "oauth_problem=callback_rejected,oauth_acceptable_callback=oob"
}

---

TESTING PERFORMED:

1. Tested with HTTP callback URL - REJECTED
2. Tested with HTTPS callback URL - REJECTED
3. Verified using production API endpoint (api.etrade.com, not apisb.etrade.com)
4. Confirmed API key is correct (353ce1949c42c71cec4785343aa36539)

---

REQUEST:

1. Please verify that the callback URL "https://web-production-9f73cd.up.railway.app/api/auth/callback" is registered for my production API key (353ce1949c42c71cec4785343aa36539).

2. If not registered, please register this callback URL.

3. If already registered, please investigate why the API continues to return "oauth_acceptable_callback=oob" and "callback_rejected" errors.

4. Please confirm if there is a propagation delay after callback URL registration, and if so, how long it takes to take effect.

---

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:

After successful callback registration, the OAuth request token call should return:
- HTTP 200 OK
- oauth_token and oauth_token_secret in the response

Instead of the current 400 error with callback_rejected.
